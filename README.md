# Touch Grass üå± Backend Application

The Touch Grass fronten application allows a user to sign in via GitHub OAuth and will create a user in the Backend database based on the information we receive from GitHub. Once a user signs in, they will have access to search plants and add plants to their dashboard where they can get specific information on the plant such as scientific name and bloom months.

# User Stories

### Welcome Page
Details: 

As a visitor
When I visit the application's landing page ("/")
there is a button with the label 'Sign in with GitHub' that allows current users to log in with their GitHub credentials
(automatically logged in if currently logged in to GitHub). It also allows new users to register and log in without manually
providing their email and a new password


Example:

### Plants by id
Details:
1. This endpoint should follow the pattern of `GET /api/v1/plants/:id`

2. If a valid plant id is passed in, a JSON object is sent back with a top-level data key that points to the plant resource with that id, and all attributes for that plant.

3. If an invalid plant id is passed in, a 404 status as well as a descriptive error message shouuld be sent back in response.
